## Build the CNN

To make our model more modular and easier to understand, let's define some blocks. As
we're building a convolution neural network, we'll create a convolution block and a dense
layer block.

[article](https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-learning-for-detecting-pneumonia-from-x-ray-images-fc9a3d9fdba8).

numbers so we will scale this down for our input.

reduce the likelikhood of the model overfitting. We want to end the model with a `Dense`
layer with one node, as this will be the binary output that determines if an X-ray shows
presence of pneumonia.

We saw earlier in this example that the data was imbalanced, with more images classified
as pneumonia than normal. We will correct for that by using class weighting:
"""

print("Initial bias: {:.5f}".format(initial_bias[0]))

print("Weight for class 1: {:.2f}".format(weight_for_1))

"""
The weight for class `0` (Normal) is a lot higher than the weight for class `1`
(Pneumonia). Because there are less normal images, each normal image will be weighted
more to balance the data as the CNN works best when the training data is balanced.
"""

"""
## Train the model
"""

"""
### Defining callbacks

The checkpoint callback saves the best weights of the model, so next time we want to use
the model, we do not have to spend time training it. The early stopping callback stops
the training process when the model starts becoming stagnant, or even worse, when the
model starts overfitting.

"""
We also want to tune our learning rate. Too high of a learning rate will cause the model
to diverge. Too small of a learning rate will cause the model to be too slow. We
implement the exponential learning rate scheduling method below.
"""

lr_schedule = tf.keras.optimizers.schedules.ExponentialDecay(

)

"""
### Fit the model

For our metrics, we want to include precision and recall as they will provide use with a
more informed picture of how good our model is. Accuracy tells us what fraction of the
labels is correct. Since our data is not balanced, accuracy might give a skewed sense of
a good model (i.e. a model that always predicts PNEUMONIA will be 74% accurate but is not
a good model).

Precision is the number of true positives (TP) over the sum of TP and false positives
(FP). It shows what fraction of labeled positives are actually correct.

Recall is the number of TP over the sum of TP and false negatves (FN). It shows what
fraction of actual positives are correct.

Since there are only two possible labels for the image, we will be using the
binary crossentropy loss. When we fit the model, remember to specify the class weights,
which we defined earlier. Because we are using a TPU, training will be quick - less than
2 minutes.
